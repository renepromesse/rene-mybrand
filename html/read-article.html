			<p>Dear Dr. King,<br><br>

				Happy belated 91st birthday, sir.<br><br>

				I often wonder what advice you might share with us if you were still down here.<br><br>

				A lot has changed in the last 52 years. Just about everyone carries a tiny, lightning-fast computer in their pocket; China has become nearly as wealthy and powerful as the United States; and the same country that instituted Jim Crow elected a black President—who served two terms!<br><br>


				Too much, however, has stayed the same. Your powerful vision of democracy "deeply rooted in the American dream that all people are created equal," has yet to be realized. An American democracy that is inclusive, substantive, and transformative is still, in the words of your dear friend Langston, a dream deferred.<br><br>


				That landmark Voting Rights Act you spearheaded? Gutted. In 2013, the Supreme Court—under the false premise that the era of discrimination was long gone—reversed decades of progress by stripping the VRA of its protective power to stop discriminatory changes to electoral systems.
				No longer bound by federal oversight, several jurisdictions with substantial records of discrimination rapidly began enacting laws that undermined minority voters’ ability to vote. Since 2014, millions of minority voters have been purged from voter rolls in an era of elections won by only a few thousand votes each.<br><br>


				And our political systems don't just suppress the vote, they actively pit citizens against each other for political gain. Our political culture has devolved into one of dehumanization and retribution. Many political actors, even our President, profit on the decay of our social fabric. And as tensions have reached a boiling point, it sometimes feels like we are inches away from civil war.<br><br>


				So, where do we go from here? Chaos or Community? It’s easy to give in to hatred and bitterness, and give up on ideals. But like you, I believe in reconciliation. I believe in redemption. I believe in our ability to grow into better versions of ourselves.<br><br>
